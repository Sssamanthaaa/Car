# Car
What once started off as small project that was taught in a club turned into an independent project. The car was first programmed by timed task and then introduced the ultrasonic sensor which uses sound waves to determine the distance within a protential obstacle. But as part of my final project I incorporated a bluetooth adapter HC-05 to send signal from my own device.
